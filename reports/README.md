# ðŸ§¾ Simulation Reports

This folder contains the **daily log reports** from the active LifeOS simulation.

Each `.md` file captures the events, behaviors, and system states observed during a full simulation day.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

These reports serve three key functions:

1. âœ… **Proof-of-Run**: Verifies that the system is functioning and producing emergent behaviors.
2. ðŸ§  **Educational Tool**: Helps others understand the flow of LifeOS and how intelligent traits activate and evolve.
3. ðŸ“š **Narrative Archive**: Tells the evolving story of the beings inside the simulation.
