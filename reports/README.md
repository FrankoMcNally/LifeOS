# Simulation Reports Directory

This folder contains the daily simulation logs generated by the Observer Module in the LifeOS framework. Each report corresponds to one simulation day.

---

## 📖 Purpose of These Reports

1. **Tracking Emergence**  
   Log how beings evolve emotionally, socially, and cognitively over time.

2. **Observer Analysis**  
   Present a narrative-style view of what the observer sees during each 24-hour simulation tick.

3. **Pattern Verification**  
   Ensure LifeOS behavior aligns with DNA evolution patterns, harmony metrics, and creativity pathways.

## 🔍 Reading Tip

Each report was written by the in-simulation Observer Module. While narrative in tone, it reflects system-level metrics and interactions using the DNA-coded behavioral logic of LifeOS.
