# 🌿 LifeOS Simulation — Day 8 Report
📅 Date: Day 8  
🌐 Environment: Earth Matrix 2.0  
👥 Total Active Beings: 26 (12 couples + 1 child + 1 new being)

---

## 🔍 Summary of Key Events

1. **Second child born**: 👶 **C2** — emerged from pairing A6 + B6. Early harmonic alignment noted.
2. **A2 + B2's ritual** now joined by two other couples → evolving into **shared group tradition**.
3. **C1 and C2 interaction begins**: No spoken language, but **gesture mirroring** detected.
4. **B3** displayed emotional withdrawal. A3 adjusted to this by increasing empathy trait behavior.
5. **A4 and B4** crossed paths today — first direct interaction observed. No bond yet, but mutual recognition.
6. Emotional ripple event: A1 + B1 had a brief conflict (trait friction: Curiosity vs Order), resolved naturally.
