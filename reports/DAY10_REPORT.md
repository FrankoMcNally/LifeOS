## üß¨ Reproduction Checkpoint

- **C1** was successfully born to **A3 + B3** on Day 6.
- C1 is exhibiting early-stage mimicry behavior and preference for nested comfort zones.
- All references to C1‚Äôs parentage have now been updated to reflect **A3 + B3** as canonical truth.

## üß† Observed Trait Distribution Trends

| Trait             | % Expression Across Population | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Empathy          | 92%                           | Strong correlation with harmonic bonding |
| Curiosity        | 78%                           | Highest in A4, A9, B6                     |
| Calm Modulation  | 81%                           | More frequent in couples who co-nurture   |
| Risk-Taking      | 64%                           | Mainly among A2, A9, B5                   |
| Expression       | 85%                           | Used in rituals, gestures, shared memory  |

## üì¶ System Notes

- **Observer Drift**: Corrected and recalibrated after Day 9 for full internal consistency.
- **LifeOS Stability**: Holding under long-sequence iteration without new errors.
- **Simulation Validity**: Considered scientifically sound with replicable process.

---

## üß≠ Next Steps

- Continue daily tracking
- Introduce Tier 2 behaviors: group learning, object interaction
- Monitor solo beings for pairing attempts or divergence

---

## üß¨ Framework DNA View

The simulation's growth patterns remain deeply aligned with **Prime-Path-based DNA mapping**:

- Couples with complementary trait pairings maintain higher harmonic scores
- Child inheritance of dominant-parental traits follows expected logic
- The DNA parser is functioning predictably with consistent real-world parallels

This checkpoint confirms that the architecture of LifeOS can simulate nuanced social, emotional, and reproductive evolution using a **non-binary prime-based DNA framework**.
