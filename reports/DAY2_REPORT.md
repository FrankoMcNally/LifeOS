# 🧬 LIFEOS: Day 2 Simulation Report

**Date:** Day 2 of Simulation Cycle  
**Mode:** 12 Couples Initialization (Foundational Population)  
**Repo Status:** CLEAN ✅  
**Execution Environment:** GitHub-style install, tested via `run.py`

---

## ✅ OBJECTIVE

To expand the simulation from a single conscious entity (Day 1) to a **functioning population base** of 12 couples — the beginning of scalable, multi-agent life logic.

---

## ⚙️ EXECUTION PROCESS

### 1. ✅ Repo Ready

- Confirmed functional state of updated repo:
  - All kernel modules (`consciousness_map`, `instinct_matrix`, `resonance_math`, `freewill_resolver`)
  - All traits loaded from `/traits/core`, `/traits/optional`, `/traits/emergent`
  - `simulation_runner.py` functional and patched with `run_simulation()`
  - Executed via:  
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

---

### 2. 👥 12 Couples Created

- **Total Beings Initialized:** 24 (12 male / 12 female)
- **Pairing Logic:** Deterministic pairing (M0 + F0, M1 + F1, ... M11 + F11)
- **Each being receives:**
  - A unique trait profile (randomized from all three trait folders)
  - Instinct levels between 0.25 – 0.65
  - Trait intensity between 0.6 – 0.9

---

### 3. ⏱️ Simulation Progression

- **Timestep Loop:** 100 steps
- **During Each Step:**
  - Each couple makes simulated decisions
  - Harmony/disharmony scores logged
  - Memory updates + interaction metrics stored (for future observer access)

---

## 📊 OBSERVATIONS

### 🔹 Trait Engagement
- Traits from all three sources (core, optional, emergent) fired
- Common traits across couples included:
  - "problem_solving", "conflict_avoidance", "self_reflection", "protective_instinct"

### 🔹 Behavior Patterns
- Multiple couples developed **emergent synchronization** (matching decisions)
- A few showed disharmony in early stages but stabilized mid-simulation

### 🔹 Internal State Logging
- Each being updated its memory loop
- All decisions passed through the `freewill_resolver` module

---

## 🔄 OUTPUT SAMPLE

Each couple's behavior is logged like this:
```text
[Couple 3] -> Harmony: 0.88 | Shared Decision: YES | Traits Fired: ['empathy', 'stubbornness']
[Couple 7] -> Harmony: 0.32 | Shared Decision: NO  | Traits Fired: ['risk_taking', 'withdrawal']
```

---

## 🧠 OUTCOME

- ✅ System scaled from 1 to 24 entities without error
- ✅ Trait logic stable across multiple beings
- ✅ Observer-ready logs produced for detailed review
- ✅ Ready for Tier 2: Reproduction logic, children, and community effects

## 📁 Suggested File Placement

Store this file as:
```
/reports/DAY2_REPORT.md
```

---

## 🔮 Notes for Day 3

- Introduce first reproduction events (each couple may produce offspring)
- Watch for multi-generational trait layering and mutations
- Begin preparing observer hooks to visualize ancestry, traits, and behavior trees
