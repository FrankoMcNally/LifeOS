# LifeOS: A Sentient DNA-Driven Operating System for Digital Entities

**LifeOS** is a modular Python-based simulation framework that models the emergence, evolution, and interaction of digital lifeforms using a trait-based DNA engine.

---

## ðŸŒ± Core Concept

At the heart of LifeOS is a DNA-like **trait system**. Entities are built from a unique combination of psychological, emotional, and instinctual traits. These traits interact with the environment, one another, and across generationsâ€”simulating behavior, growth, and social complexity.

## ðŸ“¦ Core Components

1. **The Kernel**  
   Prime Resonance equations, Tri-Linear Trait Matrix, Instinct Matrix, and Free Will Resolver.

2. **Trait Library**  
   JSON-defined behavioral traits divided into `core`, `optional`, and `emergent` folders.

3. **Simulation Engine**  
   Entity class, environment logic, trait resonance evaluator, and lifecycle triggers.

4. **Entity Lifecycle**  
   Entities receive inputs, adapt, respond, pair, reproduce, and pass DNA forward.

5. **Environment**  
   Dynamic variables such as social stress, temperature, or spiritual belief seeds affect trait expression.

6. **Export & Expansion**  
   Designed for multiverse simulation (e.g., Earth Matrix project), with extensible modular architecture.

## ðŸš€ Run the Simulation

To test the simulation in a high-stress scenario:

```bash
python example_1_high_stress_scenario.py
```

---

## âœ… Running Tests

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## ðŸ“š Knowledge Origin

This system is based on a hybrid of computational psychology, synthetic biology, and the Prime Path DNA model. It supports advanced research into AI ethics, evolution, and emergent consciousness.
