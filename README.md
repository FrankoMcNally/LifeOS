# ðŸš€ LifeOS: A Digital Life Simulation Framework

LifeOS is a modular simulation engine for evolving digital life systems, inspired by real-world cognitive traits, emotional mechanics, and subconscious layers.

Built to explore emergent behaviors, adaptability, and evolution â€” LifeOS is designed for AI researchers, simulation enthusiasts, and pioneers building toward sentient digital agents.

This project powers simulations like **Earth Matrix** and **Adam & Eve**, where digital DNA, instincts, and free will combine to tell stories of synthetic evolution.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `TraitCompiler`           | Loads and processes personality traits       |
| `ConsciousnessMap`        | Maps real-time awareness & focus             |
| `InstinctMatrix`          | Governs survival and automated decisions     |
| `FreeWillResolver`        | Resolves decisions vs instinctual impulses   |
| `ResonanceMath`           | Handles emotional harmony/conflict           |
| `SymbolicLanguageEngine`  | Models inner thought and language use        |
| `EvolutionEngine`         | (Stub) Placeholder for generational evolution |

## ðŸ§¬ Future Goals

- Implement DNA-based trait mutation and generational memory
- Add environment-driven adaptation (feedback loops)
- Train digital agents in open-world simulation tests
- Use LifeOS as an AI reasoning kernel for creative machines
