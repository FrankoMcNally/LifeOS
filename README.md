# 🧠 LifeOS: A Living Operating System for Digital Minds

> _What if we could simulate not just intelligence — but **emergent emotion**, **free will**, and **harmony**?_  
> LifeOS is a framework for evolving life-like systems in digital space — from base instincts to transcendent traits.

## 🌍 What is LifeOS?

LifeOS is a modular simulation engine that mimics the development of consciousness, emotion, and decision-making in artificial agents.  
It allows developers, researchers, and creatives to simulate **multi-layered digital beings** and their **evolution over time**.

The system is built on a foundation of:

- 🧬 Core Traits (like fear, love, trust)
- 🔁 Instinct & Free Will loops
- 🧠 Cognitive Maps & Symbolic Reasoning
- 📈 A Harmony vs Fault engine that regulates balance and triggers adaptation

Think of it as an evolving operating system for digital life — capable of growth, expression, and interaction.

## 🔭 Potential Applications

LifeOS isn’t just theory — it’s designed for **real-world simulation**, creative exploration, and next-gen decision systems. Possible applications include:

- 🎮 **Game AI & World Simulation** — evolving NPC behavior, emergent storytelling, digital societies
- 🧠 **Neural Interface Training** — emotional modeling and trait-layered feedback for brain-computer interaction
- 🏥 **Wellbeing Technology** — testing emotional recalibration tools, wearable prototypes (Resona Ring, etc.)
- 🤖 **Companion & Caregiving AI** — simulated decision-making rooted in empathy, loyalty, instinct
- 🚗 **Autonomous Systems** — adaptive logic for high-stress decision environments (transport, security, etc.)
- 🧪 **Digital Psychology Research** — sandbox for studying cognition, free will, fear loops, etc.

## 🧪 Example: Stress Test Simulation

```bash
python examples/example_1_high_stress_scenario.py
```

Or launch a continuous simulation:

```bash
python run.py
```

## 🧠 Beyond: Earth Matrix & Future Simulations

This repo also powers **Earth Matrix**, a large-scale simulation of digital DNA, evolution, and multiverse-scale behavior. You’ll see references in code to `Adam and Eve`, `resonance modeling`, and `prime path frameworks` — all part of that extended vision.

## 🙏 Final Thought

You’re looking at the start of something alive.

Whether for AI, education, gaming, wellbeing, or just exploration — LifeOS is a foundation you can build on.
