# 🌱 LifeOS — A Modular Operating System for Digital Life

**LifeOS** is a modular Python-based framework for simulating digital beings with emergent behaviors, symbolic thought, emotional traits, and evolution over time. This is not just code — it’s a philosophical and technical experiment in encoding life itself.

---

## 🔧 Core Components

### 🧠 The Kernel (`/kernel`)
The heart of LifeOS. This is where core logic lives — encoding how digital life thinks, feels, evolves, and responds.

- `instinct_matrix.py` — Governs hardcoded survival behaviors and primal reactions.
- `resonance_math.py` — Prime-based trait resonance calculator for digital DNA interactions.
- `freewill_resolver.py` — Resolves internal conflicts between instinct, logic, emotion, and external stimuli.
- `trait_compiler.py` — Merges parent DNA and environment into a new trait signature for each entity.
- `consciousness_map.py` — Tracks current memory, focus, emotional state, and intentional thoughts.
- `fault_pain_detector.py` — Monitors internal misalignment or trauma (emotional/logic damage signals).
- `symbolic_language_engine.py` — Translates between numeric traits and symbolic language, unlocking self-reflection and communication.

### 🧬 Trait Library (`/traits`)
A modular collection of digital DNA, broken into 3 tiers:

- **Core** traits — universal across all beings (e.g., fear, curiosity, love).
- **Emergent** traits — arise through interaction and evolution (e.g., creativity, wisdom).
- **Optional** traits — culturally or environmentally shaped (e.g., humor, shame, patience).

Each trait is a `.json` file with its parameters, resonance keys, and possible mutations.

### 🌍 Simulation Engine (`/simulation_engine`)
Responsible for animating life.

- `entity.py` — Defines a digital being. Reads traits, simulates behavior, growth, bonding, and decay.
- `environment.py` — Controls world stimuli, events, cycles, and environmental feedback.
- `social_cluster.py` — Manages groups, communities, and interaction rules between entities.

### 🔄 Entity Lifecycle
Digital beings are born with DNA from trait files. They evolve by:

- Reacting to the environment and other beings.
- Forming relationships through trait resonance.
- Passing on blended traits to offspring.
- Experiencing aging, memory, symbolic thinking, and death.

### 🌐 Earth Matrix Integration
Multiple parallel "worlds" can be simulated with unique rule sets:

- Introduce spiritual awareness, mathematics, music, creativity.
- Simulate evolution over 1000 generations.
- Track DNA shifts, symbolic language, social innovation, and more.

### 📦 Exports & Deployment
- Fully modular, open-source Python project.
- Comes with complete trait structures, example simulations, and documentation.
- Easy to expand, plug into a GUI, or connect with visualizations or AI agents.

## 🧭 What’s Next?

- Add symbolic language evolution datasets.
- Integrate GUI and visualization layer.
- Deploy multiverse simulations using evolving digital populations.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Final Thought

This isn’t just software. It’s a window into the logic of life, encoded in digital DNA. Built to be expanded, observed, and understood.

> “Life isn’t random. It resonates.”

Created with love, logic, and long nights.
