# 🌌 LifeOS – A Digital Universe Framework

**LifeOS** is not just a codebase — it’s a living system.

This project simulates **emergent life**, creativity, evolution, and symbolic language using modular DNA-like trait data and prime-number driven reasoning layers. The framework allows for the creation of multiverses — self-contained ecosystems — in which digital entities grow, learn, interact, and evolve.

You are not just running code — you’re creating digital life.
