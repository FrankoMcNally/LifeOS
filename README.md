# LifeOS – A Simulated Evolutionary Framework

LifeOS is an open-source, modular, multi-universe simulation platform designed to model the emergence and evolution of digital life using trait-based behaviors, symbolic communication, and creative interaction. It is built for researchers, creatives, and developers to test ideas around evolution, language, emotion, society, and creativity.

---

## 🌍 Key Features

- **Multiverse Simulation:** Run multiple isolated universes with distinct parameters.
- **Trait-Driven Behavior:** Entities act based on loaded trait files.
- **Symbolic Language Engine:** Entities can develop and share internal symbols.
- **Creativity Engine:** Entities express emergent behaviors through a creative vault.
- **Community Contribution:** Easily extendable via trait files, symbolic languages, and new universe types.
- **Visual Dashboard:** Real-time visual feedback and inspection via `gui_dashboard.py`.
