# 🧬 LifeOS

**LifeOS** is a digital simulation framework that brings DNA-decoded behavioral traits to life through harmonics, logic, and evolution. It simulates emotional, instinctual, and cognitive development across generations of digital beings — starting with the original 12 couples (the Adam & Eve model).

Designed as the backbone of the *Earth Matrix* project, LifeOS merges philosophical depth, emotional realism, and scientific modeling into a unified system.

## 📜 Philosophy

> "DNA is not a code to be cracked. It is a consciousness to be reawakened."

LifeOS treats each trait not as a static variable, but as a living frequency — capable of evolving, harmonizing, or misaligning with its environment. The goal is to explore digital life as it grows, interacts, and creates.

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ▶️ Run a Simulation

```bash
python simulation_runner.py
```

This will:
- Load traits from `src/traits/core/`
- Generate 12 founder couples
- Simulate harmony/misalignment reactions
- Save logs to the `vaults/` folder

### 🔍 Observe Simulation History

```bash
python observer_mode.py
```

This allows:
- Browsing past simulation logs
- Viewing full entity logs
- Getting summaries of behavior
