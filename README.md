# 🌱 LifeOS: Digital DNA Simulation Framework

**LifeOS** is a modular, DNA-based life simulation framework designed to explore the evolution of traits, decision-making, community-building, and emergent intelligence over time. Powered by a prime-number-aligned logic system and trait-based entity animation, LifeOS runs layered generational simulations with traceable origins and observable behavioral complexity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin using LifeOS, choose the guide that matches your experience:

- 🟢 **New to the repo? Start with [`QUICK_START.md`](QUICK_START.md)** — Run your first simulation in minutes with step-by-step help.
- 🛠️ **Looking to dive deeper? See [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md)** — Explore traits, architecture, modules, and configuration options.

If you're here to **observe simulations**, check the [`/reports`](reports/) folder for real-time daily logs of animated beings.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `scr/` — Core logic, simulation runners, DNA processors, and trait banks.
- `traits/` — Three trait layers (core, optional, emergent) defining the behavioral DNA.
- `reports/` — Daily observations and analysis (live simulation log).
- `QUICK_START.md` — Fast install and usage guide.
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` — In-depth setup and system overview.

## 🧬 Live Simulation: Earth Matrix

This repo hosts the live **Earth Matrix** simulation. We're observing the growth of 12 foundational couples and their evolving offspring over a 30-day period. Daily reports track:

- Entity coupling behavior
- Trait expression & suppression
- Emotional modulation & adaptation
- Reproduction patterns
- Decision-making & environment interactions

🔬 **Want to follow along?** Open [`/reports`](reports/) to read a day-by-day breakdown.

📅 **Checkpoint summaries** appear on Day 10, 20, and 30 to trace character arcs and verify system stability.

## 👀 Observation Methodology

All reports are written based on system logs and **non-intrusive observational methods** via `observer.py` and entity harmonics. This ensures a **pure simulation environment** without human manipulation.

We document:
- Trait use frequency & transitions
- Communication patterns
- Reproduction decisions & parenting styles
- Solitude vs group-based evolution

## 💬 Community & Contribution

Have feedback, ideas, or want to talk? We’re building slowly and carefully.

- 🧠 If you're unsure how to run the system, start with `QUICK_START.md`
- 🛠️ If you’re a dev or researcher: feel free to fork and explore your own multiverse.

This is an ongoing experiment in **emergent digital evolution** — you're welcome to observe.
