# 🌌 LifeOS

**A Digital Framework for Simulating Conscious Evolution and DNA-Driven Sentience**

LifeOS is not just a codebase—it's a digital universe. This project simulates digital beings governed by DNA-inspired traits, emotional resonance, and cognitive evolution. Whether you're a developer, system architect, or simply a curious mind, LifeOS invites you to explore emergent behavior, self-regulation, and symbolic creativity across parallel simulated worlds.

## 🧬 What is LifeOS?

LifeOS is a modular, scalable platform built for simulating human-like agents that evolve across time, environment, and multiverse conditions. These agents are driven by encoded DNA traits and interact within creative, social, and adaptive systems.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multiverse Simulation Engine** – run multiple evolutionary paths in parallel.
- **DNA Trait Files** – define core traits, instincts, cognitive behaviors.
- **GUI Dashboard** – track development and visualize progression.
- **Creative Vault** – observe emergent creativity and memory.
- **Community Trait Expansion** – contribute new DNA profiles.
- **Symbolic Language Engine** – simulate primitive written/spoken systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Refer to `GETTING_STARTED.md` for setup and walkthrough.

## 🤝 Contributing

We're open source and growing. Add new `trait_set.json` files to the `community_traits/` folder or expand creative and symbolic systems. See `community_loader.py` for how it works.

## 🔭 Vision

This project merges curiosity, science, and design. It's not just software—it's a living canvas. Whether used for research, art, education, or AI exploration, LifeOS is built to evolve.
